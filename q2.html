<h3><mark>We used the 5 Whys and Design thinking process to come up with our main topic.</mark></h3>
<h4>Why did we choose mental health awareness?</h4>
<p>Because mental health is an important topic. It is often laughed at, it is not taken seriously by the majority. Spreading awareness about this is essential and beneficial not only to those who are experiencing poor mental health, but everyone who feels emotions.</p>
<h4>Why should mental health be talked about?</h4>
<p>Because mental health affects the person’s well being. Having poor mental health can result to attitude changes. These attitude changes can affect a person’s academic standing, work performance, and personal life.</p>
<h4>Why does mental health affect us?</h4>
<p>It can affect our attitude, our work, and our thinking. We can experience hallucinations or anxiety if we aren’t treated with proper care.</p>
<h4>Why is mental health important?</h4>
<p>Because we can't function properly when we have poor mental health; therefore, mental health is critical for our well-being in order to function effectively.</p>
<h4>Why is mental health awareness important to Junior High School students?</h4>
<p>Our mental health has a direct influence on our ability to learn new things and comprehend new ideas, so it has a significant impact on students and others. Working on homework or attending classes may become difficult while suffering from depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues. The effects of mental health on our mood and ability to function on a daily basis can have far-reaching implications in many aspects of our lives.</p>
<br>
<p>Our team will focus on educational films or podcasts talking about what is Mental Health and why it should be talked about and looked after.</p>
<p>Our stream aims to communicate with those who suffer from mental health disorders, Junior High School Students often keep quiet whenever they feel sad, we aim to change that. We expect our stream to be fascinating and educational. The Junior High School students in APEC V. Luna reached 394 students, our goal is to not only reach those students in APEC V. Luna, but also the other JHS Students all over the world. We will consume 20-40 minutes for our stream, we will be sharing about the Essence of Mental Health Awareness. The key points of our stream is; what is mental health, the causes and effects of poor mental health, and why mental health should be talked about.</p>
